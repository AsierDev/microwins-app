- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microwins.git
   cd microwins
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup:**
   
   a. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   
   b. Add Android/iOS apps to your Firebase project
   
   c. Download configuration files:
      - Android: `google-services.json` → `android/app/`

### Notification System

**Problem Solved:** Android 12+ blocks recurring exact alarms, making traditional notification scheduling unreliable.

**Solution:** WorkManager + Firestore multi-process architecture

```
Main App Process              WorkManager Process
================              ===================
User creates habit            (every 15 minutes)
    ↓                                ↓
Save to Firestore  ←─────→  Read from Firestore
    ↓                                ↓
Save userId to          Read userId from
SharedPreferences       SharedPreferences
                                     ↓
                            Check for due habits
                                     ↓
                            Show notifications
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Works across app restarts
- ✅ Survives phone reboots
- ✅ Multi-process safe (Firestore + SharedPreferences)
- ✅ Notifications arrive within 0-15 minutes of scheduled time

**Trade-off:** Notifications may arrive up to 15 minutes late (Android WorkManager limitation)

## 🎮 Gamification System

### Overview

MicroWins features a comprehensive gamification system designed to maximize user engagement and habit consistency through psychological reinforcement mechanics.

### Achievement Categories

| Category | Icon | Focus | Badges |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| **Streak Master** | 🔥 | Daily consecutive completions | 4 badges (3, 7, 30, 100 days) |
| **Consistency Champion** | 📅 | Monthly completion frequency | 3 badges (7, 20, 28+ days/month) |
| **Weekly Warrior** | 📈 | Weekly volume | 3 badges (5, 10, 20 habits/week) |
| **Milestone Master** | 🏆 | Cumulative achievements | 4 badges (10, 50, 100, 500 total) |
| **Perfect Week** | ⭐ | Weekly perfection | 2 badges (3+, 5+ habits) |

### Level Progression

- **10 Levels**: Principiante → Novato → Aprendiz → Practicante → Dedicado → Comprometido → Experto → Maestro → Gran Maestro → Leyenda
- **EXP Formula**: Each level requires `100 * level` additional EXP
- **Bonuses**: Streak bonuses (+5 to +20 EXP), first of day (+5 EXP), perfect week (+15 EXP)

## 🔔 Notification Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| App open | Notification arrives 0-15 min after scheduled time |
| App closed | WorkManager continues checking every 15 min |
| Phone restart | WorkManager resumes automatically |
| No internet | Works offline (reads from Firestore cache) |

**Why 15 minutes?**
- Android restricts background tasks to save battery
- WorkManager is the only reliable solution on Android 12+
- Same approach used by Todoist, Microsoft To-Do, Google Keep

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Testing Notifications

1. **Sign in** to the app (saves userId to SharedPreferences)
2. **Create a habit** with a reminder time 5-10 minutes from now
3. **Close the app** completely
4. **Wait** for the notification (arrives within 15 min)

**View logs:**
```bash
flutter logs --device-id=<device-id> | grep -i "workmanager\|flutter"
```

Expected output:
```
🔔 WorkManager: Checking for due notifications...
📦 Found 1 habits in Firestore
✅ Showed notification for: [habit name]
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase
- `android/app/google-services.json` - Android config
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` - iOS config
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` - Generated by FlutterFire CLI

### Runtime Configuration
- `AI_PROXY_URL` (`--dart-define`) - Backend endpoint for AI suggestions

### Secure AI Backend (Cloud Functions)
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

2. Set the OpenRouter secret in Firebase Secret Manager:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

3. Deploy functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

4. Configure app runtime with your function base URL:
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=AI_PROXY_URL=https://europe-west1-<your-project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/api
```

The app calls `POST /ai/habits` on that backend URL.

### Android Permissions
Required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `INTERNET` - Network access
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Show notifications (Android 13+)
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Restart WorkManager after reboot
- `WAKE_LOCK` - Keep WorkManager running

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Notifications not arriving

**Issue:** "Found 0 habits in Firestore" in logs

**Solution:**
1. Sign out and sign in again (saves userId to SharedPreferences)
2. Verify habit has a `reminderTime` set
3. Check Firestore rules allow read access

**Issue:** Notifications delayed more than 15 minutes

**Solution:**
- Check battery optimization settings (Settings → Apps → MicroWins → Battery → Unrestricted)
- Verify WorkManager is running: `adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler | grep microwins`

### Firebase connection issues

**Issue:** "No user logged in" in WorkManager logs

**Solution:**
- Ensure user is signed in before creating habits
- Check `SharedPreferences` has `current_user_id` key
